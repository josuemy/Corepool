# Corepool
During my internship at Procore, I had the opportunity to develop a mobile app that improved the parking and commuting logistics for the company's employees. I worked along with other 3 interns who shared my passion to learn new technologies and develop a good quality product. By the end of a week and a half, our product was completely functional and looked like this:
